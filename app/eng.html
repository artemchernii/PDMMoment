							Interview to HUGO MARÇAL | Sendit General Manager
						</div>
						<div class="hero_content__title">
							Sendit
						</div>
						<div class="hero_content__descr">
							Hugo has been with the company since 2007 and is formed in Computer and Informatics
							Engineering. He states that what motivates him daily at a professional level is to have the
							opportunity of doing the work he likes, embrace challenges out of his comfort zone, work
							with an excellent team and contribute decisively to the success of Sendit.
						</div>
						<div class="hero_content__question">
							When was Sendit founded, how have been the company’s journey and how is its adaptation
							process going within the Go4Mobility and the PDM Group?
						</div>
						<div class="hero_content__answer">
							“Sendit was founded in 2004. Concerning its journey, we can talk about the before and after
							Go4 world, but I think we should focus on the world after Go4. The years of 2017 and 2018
							were, absolutely, of adaptation. In each one's mind, there were competing companies and
							platforms that have now joined forces to strengthen their market position. The entry into
							the group resulted in a natural and positive adjustment, in order to align with the
							strategic ideas and objectives of the direction. In practice, the work of fusion continued
							in 2018 and consisted, objectively, in the consolidation of companies’ strategies,
							standardization of working methods, optimization of processes and definition of a solid path
							for the Go4 subgroup.
							<br><br>
							In fact, it was a year where we were consolidating worlds and cultures and, nowadays, we
							already feel part of the group and like we are one.”
						</div>
						<div class="hero_content__question">
							What were the most significant changes in the company after joining the PDM Group? What
							do you consider to be the advantages of belonging to the Group?
						</div>
						<div class="hero_content__answer">
							“Belonging to the PDM Group gives us, among other things, a significant competitive
							advantage by the possibility of having the technic resources nearby. That is, we do not need
							to spend a lot of time on technical recruitment, which in our business is an important
							factor. I highlight the excellent collaboration environment that we have found from the
							first minute we joined the Group in 2017 and, since then, we feel supported at all levels.
							<br><br>
							Being present in a Group with the experience, dimension, maturity and quality of PDM is very
							important to learn, improve and achieve the objectives in a faster and more effective way.”
						</div>
						<div class="hero_content__question">
							How do you describe your team and which skills do you want to develop better in 2019?
						</div>
						<div class="hero_content__answer">
							"I believe that it may exist a perception that there is a Sendit team and another Go4, but
							in reality they are practically one. We share services and departments, such as Marketing
							and Finance, we just do not share the commercial and technical teams. The first one due to
							strategic orientation and the second one because we work on different technologies. We have
							an excellent environment and I can emphasize the mutual help and team spirit. All of us, in
							general, get along very well with each other. We accept ourselves even when there are
							divergences of opinion or method. We end up talking and, through constructive criticism, we
							“guide our boat to good port.
							<br><br>
							I consider that we have to improve the internal communication. That is to say, we talk to
							each other and we are very much in tune, but many times, it happens only between closed
							groups (heads, operatives, technical teams) and if the decisions are not communicated in a
							correct and linear way, it leads to misunderstandings. This is a clear example of a positive
							situation that becomes negative because of the misperception of communication, by those who
							did not participate actively in the decision process. Consequently, it is a challenge that
							we have been working on. When we make decisions, they should be reported to the teams in a
							coherent, clear and objective way, so that there are no doubts or questions remaining.”

						<div class="hero2_content__question">
							Do you have in mind any significant change or relevant investment planned for 2019?
						</div>
						<div class="hero2_content__answer">
							“Internally, I highlight the creation of a Human Resources department as an important
							investment in the company, along with Go4Mobility, besides the restructuring and
							uniformisation of many processes, whose purpose is to simplify and optimize our day by day.
							We believe in a sustainable growth and, when with think about expansion, we want to be sure
							that we are capable of respond to every level and not only at a technical level. In the
							particular case of Human Resources, we believe in the immense value of our team and that is
							why we want to join forces to provide even better working conditions.
							<br><br>
							At an external level, we want to continue the internationalization process in Mozambique and
							Spain, where we launched, during 2018, our <a target="_blank"
								href="https://usendit.es">uSendit</a> platform
							and where we have been investing in the establishment of local teams, focused in the brand
							visibility and commercialization of our products. These markets are strategic for us, but
							the international goal is more ambitious and we pretend for the platform to be
							commercialized online in any part of the world, covering different needs at a language,
							currency and payment methods level. In any case, besides the products that we already have,
							we look closely to the diverse innovations in the sector (Marketing Automation, RCS,
							WhatsApp4Business), opportunities and needs, looking for developing solutions that can
							complement our offer and that can distinguish our company as an organization that can create
							real value to the clients. We have as goal to promote Sendit as a company that is not just a
							SMS or Email services supplier, but a reference company for Communication and Digital
							Marketing solutions, properly specialized and capable of responding to the demands of the
							various activity sectors.”
						</div>
						<div class="hero2_content__question">
							What are the main objectives for the coming years?
						</div>
						<div class="hero2_content__answer">
							“The experience that we have, allows us to make our own judgement, which is why in this
							market and with the technological pace of change that we assist daily, we can not think at a
							high distance, because 6 months can already be considered medium-to-long term. Despite that,
							and keeping our feet on the ground, our first main goal is to be well succeeded in a market
							such as the Spanish one, which is five times higher than the Portuguese in terms of people
							and, perhaps, ten times in terms of turnover.
							<br><br>
							However, in addition to the new market, we intend to increase our penetration at a national
							level and also in Mozambique. We believe in our potential and in the possibility of also
							having, within a horizon of 2 to 3 years, a local presence in other countries. We want to
							achieve our ideas by reaching for technological innovation, adopting the best practices of
							the industry and by constantly accompanying the market evolution. All of this is based on
							the idea of a sustainable growth, transversal to all the company departments.”
						</div>
						<div class="hero2_content__question">
							What is the first idea (s) that you would like to come into people’s mind when they hear
							the word "Sendit"?
						</div>
						<div class="hero2_content__answer">
							“My partner in the Communication and Digital Marketing Strategy.”
						</div>
						<div class="hero2_content__question">
							How do you describe the feeling of representing Sendit?
						</div>
						<div class="hero2_content__answer">
							“It is an honor to be part of Sendit, accompanying the growth and contributing to its
							success along the years.”
						</div>
						<div class="hero2_content__question">
							What message would you like to convey to the employees?
						</div>
						<div class="hero2_content__answer">
							“A thank you and confidence message. An appreciation for what we are and confidence in our
							future. We have a team of multiple valences, experienced, productive, motivated and with an
							enormous potential to overcome the challenges arising. We are a solid, flexible, dynamic and
							increasingly agile company, where the difference of opinion is valued and the decisions can
							be taken quickly, allowing to act with promptness. All of this, allied with a strong
							technical component, gives us a competitive advantage in the market and the confidence to
							walk a sustainable growth path to obtain success at all levels.”

							On March 14 and 15, another edition of the well-known Retreat of
							the PDM Group was held at the Vila Galé Évora Hotel.
							<br /><br />
							<b>Diversity Brings Us Together </b> was the theme of this year,
							which had some news compared to the previous editions. In this
							event, where the purpose was to encourage the feeling of
							togetherness among everyone, valuing the diversity present
							within the Group, the format was different, lasted 2 days and
							happened elsewhere. <br /><br />
							About <b>210 employees</b> from several companies of the Group
							were present at the Retreat, namely from
							<b>PDMFC, Go4Mobility, Go4Communication, Sendit, Scope Invest,
								Apps4Mobility</b>
							and <b>MyFarm</b>, who were able to get to know each other, have
							fun and carry out different activities. The collaborators had
							the opportunity to realize a <b>Peddy Paper</b> and to attend
							the <b>Light Talks</b>, a novelty in the Group that had its
							first edition at the Retreat.
							<div class="retreat_info__text-img">
								<img src="img/retreat2.png" alt="retreat" />
							</div>
							<br /><br />
							As usual, the event ended with the <b>Group Conference</b>, this
							time on Saturday afternoon. Luis Landeiro (CEO and CTO of
							PDMFC), Rui Cordeiro (General Manager of Go4Mobility), Miguel
							Campos (Chairman and Director of PDMFC’s R&D Department) and
							Francisco Loureiro (COO and Director of PDMFC’s Solutions
							Department) shared different topics and perspectives about the
							future and the strategies for the companies. <br /><br />
							It is also worth mentioning the two moments of entertainment,
							Cante Alentejano and Stand Up, during the dinner and the
							Saturday Conference, respectively.
							<br /><br />
							Retreat is an annual event that intends to promote relationships
							between the elements of the teams and companies, improve the
							internal communication and provide moments of leisure and
							interaction. You can remember the best moments, anytime you
							want, in our <b>gallery</b>.

									MyFarm intends to help the Portuguese farmers to drain their products on a regular

									platform, with the main purpose of allowing <b>consumers</b> to receive the best and
									freshest products at home and the possibility (in the near future) of managing their
									own Virtual Farm, at the same time that the <b>small producers</b> sell their
									products in
									the desired quantities, at fair prices. <br />
									<br />
									The platform offers 4 product categories and 3 terms of sale, and is a connection
									(currently lost) between the producer and the final costumer. It is also important
									to mention that about 50% of the products have <b>biological certification</b>.
									However,
									all the producers produce in a sustainable and organic way, even without the
									certification.
									<br /><br />
									Last year, the company saw its <b>income increase</b>. Also in 2018, some events
									were held
									before the summer, with the intention of inviting and raising producers to be part
									of the project. The events took place in Councils and Parish Councils, namely in the
									Council of Ferreira do Alentejo and Vidigueira, among others. The company was
									present on the Eco-Schools day of IPBeja, an international program of the
